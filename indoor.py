#In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python 
# that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input 
# in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.
# Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, 
# as by parsing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# Prompt the user for input
user_input = input("Please enter some text: ")

# Output the input in lowercase
print(user_input.lower())
